# Video audition

I'm plan to create a video course about [Koa v2](https://github.com/koajs/koa/tree/v2.x/) with the latest Node.js features like `async/await` for building a robust JSON Web API for modern SPA and mobile applications.

**Possible outline:**

* Getting started.
* Add and create middleware.
* Using `async/await` with asynchronous operations.
* Advanced routing.
* Usage with MongoDB database with `mongoose.`.
* Pagination and bulk requests.
* Configuring authentication with JWT.
* Export database content to a file download using _streams_.
* Deploying with PM2.
